       <h1> <center>You Are Admirable</center></h1>
       <p> <center>You are so hardworking and a kind man. Your passion inspires me to take more initiative in my life. 
        I love you so much, I feel like I am always learning from you. You are one of my best friends, I feel like 
        I can come to you with anything, whether I need advice, or a shoulder to cry on, you always make me feel safe.
        The longer we spend time together the more my heart grows to love you, I love finding out new stories, or new habits about you.
        I love seeing you happy and laughing. Right now you are asleep but you look so beautiful, and I know I am lucky to have you. I'm lowkey 
        crying right now, tears of joy ofcourse. I don't think you'll ever be able to realize how much I truly love you. When you were crying
        it made me feel so sad, I wanted to hug you forever, i want to take away your pain, but I know that I can't, so I will always stand
        beside you when you need someone to lean on, my lap will always be waiting for your head to lay in it, and if you cry a river, Ill be the ocean
        I'll catch all of your tears that run off, I love you forever. HAPPY TEN MONTH ANNIVERSARYYY MY SWEET MONKEY BABY </center>
